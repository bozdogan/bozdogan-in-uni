BIM304 - Computer Algorithm Design
Homework II

Develop an application that finds the closest pair of a set of points recursively. Assume that there are at least two
points in the input and that all the points are distinct.

If the input is
4
1.0 1.0
2.0 2.0
4.0 5.0
7.0 8.0
then the output should be : (2,2)-(1,1)= 1.414214

Details

Size of the input is unknown, it can be large up to the limits of physical memory
The format of the data is as follows
- The first element specify the number of points in the input data
- Subsequent line contains the x-coordinate of a point followed by the y-coordinate, separated by a single
space (check the given input files)

The output must show the closest pair of points and the distance between them in the given format in example
The formula to compute distance between two points a=(x1,y1) and b=( x2,y2) is
Your algorithm must fit into the divide-and-conquer strategy
The running time should be Θ(n⋅logn) where n is the number of points

Submissions may be written in Java, when you pick a language, you have to do your other homework with the
same platform
