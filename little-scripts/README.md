These are some little scripts I kept.

- `birsifir.py`
  Fake matrix terminal. Binary numbers in green on black background.
- `hackertoy.py`
  Fake hacking simulation made for fun. It prints hacky looking text so you feel like a hacker.
- `roman_number.py`
  Converts numbers to roman numerals and vice-versa.
- `kusdili_cevirici.py`
  Converts a sentence to "bird tongue". (It's a made-up language. Same concept as Pig Latin.)
- `skipaletter_code.py`
  A basic pen-and-paper cipher that interlaces letters of a word to make them unrecognizable.
- **`toylandin01.py`**
  Probably least secure encryption software as all it does is XORing the single byte key on the message :/
- `unspace.py`
  Utility for bulk renaming files so they don't have spaces in file names.
- `yilingunu.py`
  Converts day of the year to month+day.
