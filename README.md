# B.Ozdoğan in Uni

Somewhat silly projects I've written in college.

- **[`little-scripts`](./little-scripts/README.md)**
  These are some little scripts I kept.

- `Subtitle_Timestamp_Shifter`
  Utility to adjust time points of a SRT subtitle file to synchronize with the movie.

- Simple ciphers:
  These uses the same technique as *toylandin01.py* in *little-scripts*.
  - `sayfrz-primitive`
  - `Toy_Cipher`

- More secure cipher applications:
  These uses 
  - `Encrypted_Text_(Disguiser_Project)`
    Python port of the *Cryptor* library in *SimonApp*
  - `SimonApp`
    Encrypted file of secrets. Uses AES for encryption. Stores "secrets" as a list of encrypted "title-content pairs".

- `AVL_Tree`
  AVL tree implementation in Python.

- `Creating_a_Maze`
  Visualizes a procedurally generated maze. Requires [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about).

- `Yılan_Oyunu`
  Snake game written in Python and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about).

- `Wordlist_Generator`
  Generates an exhaustive word list with given alphabet. If you have time, that is..

- `hidef_32k_art`
  Programmatically generated high-def images. Written in C.

- `VCard_Parser`
Lists the contacts in a [VCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format) file.

- `Web_Scraping`
  Simple web scrapper that grabs latest announcements from my department's website.

- School Assignments:

    Word guessing game played over TCP/IP. (Computer Networks)
  - `FindClosestPoints`
    Finds closest points in given set. (Computer Algorithm Design)
  - `duplicate_detector`
    Finds duplicate files in a directory. Recursively scans subdirectories. (Computer Programming IV)
  - `Sort_Locale`
    Sorts lines of a text file. Works like GNU's `sort` utility but also sorts locale-specific characters correctly. (Computer Programming IV)
  - `mSTP`
    "Multiple Travelling Salesman Problem" solver.  (Computer Programming IV)

- `Müsrifmatik`
  ***[visible confusion]*** <!-- I'm not sure what it is supposed to be, either. -->
